1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And now, great stories from the past. But as usual, a few names for the blackboard before we begin.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
First, Beowulf. B-E-O-W-U-L-F.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
B-E-O-W-U-L-F. B-E-O-W-U-L-F. B-E-O-W-U-L-F. Son of Enfield said.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, I wonder if any of you know what these old Anglo-Saxon storytellers were called.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:52,000
They were called Glee Men. Glee means joy. And the Glee Men were bringers of joy because people enjoyed their stories and songs.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sometimes, when I sit by the fire and think about that story of Beowulf, I seem to hear the Glee Men playing his harp.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I seem to hear him say. So. So. What?

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Bro, tell me we still know how to speak of kings.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The Speardanes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The Speardanes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There was Shield Sheafson, scourge of many tribes, a wrecker of meadbenches, rampaging among foes.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This terror of the Hull troops had come far.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
A foundling to start with, he would flourish later on as his powers waxed and his worth was proved.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yet he lived and prospered, grew in strength and stature under the heavens.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In the end, each clan on the outlying coasts beyond the Whale Road had to yield to him and begin to pay tribute.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That was one good king.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That was good kuning. He was a good king.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Afterwards, a boy child was born to Shield. Beowulf's name was known through the north.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And a young prince must be prudent like that, giving freely while his father lives,

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
so that afterwards in age, when fighting starts, steadfast companions will stand by him and hold the line.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Behavior that's admired is the path to power among people everywhere.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Shield was still thriving when his time came and he crossed over into the Lord's keeping.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
His warrior band did what he bade them when he laid down the law among the Danes.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They shouldered him out to the sea's flood, the chief they revered, who had long ruled them.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A ring-whirled prow rode in the harbour, ice-clad, outbound, a craft for a prince.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And this beautiful ship, what a way to go.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And of course, it brings with it the notion that death is but a point of embarkation in a journey.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It must have meant so much to them, hence the effort of bringing this massive ship,

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
six tonnes at least, with light, all the way up here.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And of course, this is where Beowulf comes in, because the opening movement of the poem

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
culminates with a magnificent account of a royal ship funeral.

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
A boat with a ringed neck rode in the haven.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And there they laid out their lord and master, giver of wound gold,

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
in the waist of the ship, in majesty by the mast.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
A mound of treasures from far countries was fetched aboard her.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And it is said that no boat was ever more bravely fitted out with the weapons of a warrior,

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
war recruitment, swords and body armour.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
High overhead they hoisted and fixed a gold signal,

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
gave him to the flood, let the seas take him.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No man can tell.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No wise man in hall or weathered veteran knows for certain who salvaged that load.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Then it fell to Beow to keep the forts.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He was well regarded and ruled the Danes for a long time

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
after his father took leave of his life on earth.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And then his heir, the great half-Dane, held sway.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He was four times a father, this fighter prince.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One by one they entered the world.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Herogar, Hrothgar, the good Halga,

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and a daughter, I have heard, who was Annala's queen.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A balm in bed for the battle-scarred Swede.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The fortunes of war favoured Hrothgar.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mighty was he above all men,

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and greater than all people were Hrothgar's people.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But Hrothgar grew old and could no longer lead his army to battle.

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Therefore, said he, I will cause a mighty hall to be built

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
where my warriors may feast and rejoice.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
By the shore it shall stand, by the sea and the marshland,

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
where all may behold it.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The Hall of Halls.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Herod was the name he had settled on it, whose utterance was law.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nor did he renege, but doled out rings and torques at the table.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The hall towered, its gables wide and high,

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and awaiting a barbarous burning.

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That doom abided, but in time it would come.

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The killer instinct unleashed among in-laws, the bloodlust rampant.

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Then a powerful demon, prowler through the dark, nursed a hard grievance.

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It harrowed him to hear the din of the loud banquet every day in the hall,

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
the heart being struck.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Grendel was the name of this grim demon.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Haunting the marches, marauding round the heath and the desolate fens.

71
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So, after nightfall, Grendel set out for the lofty house

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to see how the ringdanes were settling into it after their drink.

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And there he came upon them, asleep from their feasting, insensible to pain.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Suddenly then, the God-cursed brute was creating havoc.

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Greedy and grim, he grabbed thirty men from their resting places

76
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and rushed to his lair, flushed up and inflamed from the raid,

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
blundering back with the butchered corpses.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
As the day broke with the dawn's light, Grendel's outrage was openly to be seen.

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Night's table laughter turned to morning's lamentation.

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Lord Hrothgar sat silent then.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The strong man mourned. Glorious king, he grieved for his thanes.

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But the next night brought new horrors, did more murders,

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
manslaughter and outrage, and shrank not from it.

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Malignant by nature, he never showed remorse.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Whoever escaped kept a weather-eye open and moved away.

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So Grendel ruled in defiance of right, one against all,

87
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
until the greatest house in the world stood empty, a deserted wallstead.

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The Lord of the Shieldings suffered under his load of sorrow,

89
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and so, before long, the news was known over the whole world.

90
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Sad lays were sung about the beset king, the vicious raids and ravages of Grendel,

91
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
his long and unrelenting feud, nothing but war,

92
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
inflicting constant cruelties on the people, atrocious hurt.

93
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He took over Heorot, haunted the Glittering Hall after dark.

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No warrior dared to ride. No hero from that land came forth in courage.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
To the Anglo-Saxon audience, Grendel's rampage was not just a random act of terror.

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
In attacking the Mead Hall, he was attacking society as a whole,

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
for here the rituals were enacted which bound their society together.

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So the hall is the centre of not only social order, but moral order.

99
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And when the monster comes in the night

100
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and starts to tear the king's followers limb from limb,

101
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it's time for the hero, Beowulf.

102
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Greatest in might among men, noble and powerful was he.

103
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Beowulf was his name.

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
BEOWULF

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He heard tell of the raids of Grendel, how for twelve years the Danes had gone in fear of him.

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He was minded to meet that monster, eager to conquer him in battle.

107
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He ordered a boat that would ply the waves. He announced his plan.

108
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
To sail the Swan's Road and search out that king, the famous prince who needed defenders.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The warrior boarded the boat as captain, a canny pilot along coast and currents.

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Men climbed eagerly up the gangplank, sand churned in surf.

111
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Warriors loaded a cargo of weapons, shining war gear in the vessel's hold.

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Then heaved out, away with a will, in their wood-wreathed ship.

113
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I groeso oia, a gwynd.

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
A hwyliodh Beowulf dros ffordd yr alarch at i dyniad yn Denmark.

115
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Over the waves, with the wind behind her and foam at her neck, she flew like a bird.

116
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Until her curved prow had covered the distance.

117
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It was the end of their voyage and the geats vaulted over the side, out onto the sand and moored their ship.

118
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There was a clash of mail and a thresh of gear.

119
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They thanked God for that easy crossing on a calm sea.

120
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When the watchman on the wall, the shielding's lookout, saw shields glittering on the gangplank

121
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
and battle equipment being unloaded.

122
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The watchman feared greatly for the safety of his king.

123
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Powerfully he brandished a huge lance and boldly he challenged them.

124
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Ho there, what strangers are you?

125
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
How is it that you step on the shores of Hrothgar, the mighty king,

126
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
with shields in your hands and swords by your sides?

127
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Do you come then to do battle?

128
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The leader of the troop unlocked his word hoard.

129
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We belong by birth to the Geat people and owe allegiance to Lord Hialach.

130
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
In his day, my father was a famous man, a noble warrior named Edgthio.

131
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He outlasted many a long winter and when on his way, all over the world, men wise in council continue to remember him.

132
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We come in good faith to find your lord and nation's shield, the son of Halfdane.

133
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Give us the right advice and direction.

134
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We've arrived here on a great errand to the Lord of the Danes

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and I believe therefore there should be nothing hidden or withheld between us.

136
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So tell us if what we have heard is true about this threat, whatever it is,

137
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
this danger abroad in the dark nights, this corpse maker mongering death in the shielding's country.

138
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I come to proffer my wholehearted help and counsel.

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can show the wise Hrothgar a way to defeat his enemy and find respite.

140
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If any respite is to reach him ever, I can calm the turmoil and terror in his mind.

141
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Otherwise, he must endure woes and live with grief for as long as his hall stands at the horizon on its high ground.

142
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And so, greatly wondering, the faithful watchmen led the strangers to Heorot.

143
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
They marched in step, hurrying on till the timbered hall rose before them, radiant with gold.

144
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Nobody on earth knew of another building like it.

145
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Majesty lodged there, its light shone over many lands.

146
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then the watchmen sought the king, saying,

147
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Almighty Lord, a band of warriors has just now come to these shores.

148
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They say they would destroy the monster Grendel.

149
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Their leader has a noble look such as only heroes have.

150
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hrothgar, protector of shieldings, replied,

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Beowulf, I knew him as a child.

152
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
His fame has reached me.

153
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Seafarers say this fighting lord has thirty men in one hand's grasp.

154
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If Grendel is his aim, then great reward will there be for his courage.

155
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The hero arose, surrounded closely by his powerful thanes.

156
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Resolute in his helmet, Beowulf spoke,

157
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Greetings to Hrothgar.

158
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I am Heorlax Kinsman, one of his hall troop.

159
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
When I was younger, I had great triumphs.

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then news of Grendel, hard to ignore, reached me at home.

161
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Sailors brought stories of the plight you suffer in this legendary hall,

162
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
how it lies deserted, empty and useless once the evening light hides itself under heaven's dome.

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So every elder and experienced councilman among my people supported my resolve

164
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to come here to you, King Hrothgar,

165
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
because all knew of my awesome strength.

166
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And so, my request, O King of Bright Danes,

167
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
dear Prince of the Shieldings, friend of the people and their ring of defence,

168
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
my one request is that you won't refuse me,

169
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
who have come this far, the privilege of purifying Harrot,

170
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
with my own men to help me and nobody else.

171
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hand to hand is how it will be, a life and death fight with the fiend.

172
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Whichever one death fells must deem it a just judgment by God.

173
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Fate goes ever as fate must.

174
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And Hrothgar smiled when he saw them, so strong they seemed and shining.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And when he looked upon Beowulf, his heart knew hope at last.

176
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hrothgar, the helmet of Shieldings, spoke.

177
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Beowulf, my friend, now take your place at the table.

178
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Relish the triumph of heroes to your heart's content.

179
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Then a bench was cleared in that banquet hall,

180
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
so the Geats could have room to be together.

181
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So the laughter started, the din got louder, and the crowd was happy.

182
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Weltheo came in, Hrothgar's queen, observing the courtesies.

183
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
With measured words, she welcomed the Geat,

184
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and thanked God for granting her wish

185
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
that a deliverer she could believe in would arrive to ease their afflictions.

186
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Beowulf, the son of Edgthil, declared.

187
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I had a fixed purpose when I put out to sea.

188
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
As I sat in the boat with my band of men,

189
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I meant to perform to the uttermost what your people wanted,

190
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
or perish in the attempt, in the fiend's clutches.

191
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And I shall fulfill that purpose,

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
prove myself with a proud deed, or meet my death here in the meat hall.

193
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This formal boast by Beowulf the Geat pleased the lady well,

194
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and she went to sit by Hrothgar, real and arrayed with gold.

195
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Then it was like old times in the echoing hall.

196
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Proud talk, and the people happy, loud and excited.

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Till the son of Heafden desired at length to leave the feast,

198
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
be away to his night's rest.

199
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Aware of the monster brooding his attack on the tall gabled hall,

200
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
from the time they had seen the sun's lightness

201
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
to the time when darkness drowns everything,

202
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
and under its shadow cover, shapes do glide dark beneath the clouds.

203
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hrothgar wished Beowulf health and good luck,

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
named him Hallwarden, and announced as followed.

205
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Never since I took up targe and sword

206
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
have I handed over Heorot, as I here do to you.

207
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Have and hold now the house of the dames.

208
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Bend your mind and your body to this task, and wake against the foe.

209
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There'll be no want of liberality if you come out alive from this ordeal of courage.

210
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The lord of the shieldings, their shelter in war,

211
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
left the meat hall to lie with Welthil, his queen and his bedmate.

212
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And before he bedded down, Beowulf, that prince of goodness, proudly asserted.

213
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When it comes to fighting, I count myself as dangerous any day as Grendel,

214
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
so it won't be a cutting edge I'll wield to mow him down, easily as I might.

215
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He has no idea of the arts of war, of shield or swordplay,

216
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
though he does possess a wild strength.

217
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
No weapons, therefore, for either this night.

218
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Unarmed, he shall face me, if face me he dares.

219
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Then down the brave man lay with his bolster under his head

220
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and his whole company of sea rovers at rest beside him.

221
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
None of them expected he would ever see his homeland again

222
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
or get back to his native place and the people who reared him.

223
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't forget Anglo-Saxon England.

224
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The England of Beowulf was a wild and underpopulated land.

225
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There were no real towns.

226
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The forests were full of wolves

227
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and the isolated farms and settlements

228
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
were little centres of human life amidst a vast, untamed nature.

229
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Their mental world was surrounded by monsters

230
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and the unseen to them was palpable

231
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
and all were threatened to burst over the threshold into the real.

232
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Come on, one reynichter.

233
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Skridan shedugenga.

234
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Gliding through the shadows came the walker in the night.

235
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
From off the moorland's misting fells came grendel stalking.

236
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That came off moor under misleothum grendel gongan.

237
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
A dull deherak.

238
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The iron-braced door turned on its hinge when his hands touched it.

239
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Rage-inflamed, wreckage-bent, he tore the hall's jaws, hastening onwards.

240
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Pacing the length of the patterned floor with his loathsome tread

241
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
while a baleful light, flame more than light, flared from his eyes

242
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and his glee was demonic.

243
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Mighty and canny, Hayalach's kinsman was keenly watching

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
for the first move the monster would make.

245
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Nor did the creature keep him waiting.

246
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
He grabbed and mauled a man on his bench.

247
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Eaten up hand and foot.

248
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Venturing closer.

249
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
His talon was raised to attack Beowulf.

250
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Where he lay on the bed, he was bearing in with open claw

251
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
when the alert hero's comeback and armlock forestalled him utterly.

252
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Hateful to each was the breath of the other.

253
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Rip in the giant flesh-frame showed then.

254
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Then an extraordinary wail arose

255
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and bewildering fear came over the Danes.

256
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
A God-cursed scream and strain of catastrophe.

257
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The howl of the loser.

258
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Shoulder muscles sprang apart. A snapping of tendons. Bone locks burst.

259
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
A breach in the giant flesh-frame showed then.

260
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
To Beowulf the glory of this fight was granted.

261
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Grendel's lot to flee the slopes fenward with flagging heart

262
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
to a den where he knew there could be no relief,

263
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
no refuge for a life at its very last stage

264
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
whose surrender day had dawned.

265
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Beowulf had cleansed Herod!

266
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Saved the whole from persecution!

267
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And as a signal to all, the hero hung the hand,

268
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
the arm and torn off shoulder, the entire limb,

269
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Grendel's whole grip beneath the soaring roof!

270
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
All gazed with joy and wonder at the arm of Grendel.

271
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Its fingers stretched up to the high roof.

272
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Where the nail should be were claws of steel, cruel spikes.

273
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Men shuddered as they looked on it.

274
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Then morning came, and many a warrior gathered,

275
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
wondering greatly at the monster's footprints,

276
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
for he'd skulked away, exhausted in spirit and beaten in battle,

277
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
bloodying the path, hauling his doom to the demon's mirror.

278
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

279
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

280
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

281
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

282
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

283
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

284
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

285
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

286
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

287
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

288
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The bloodshot warrior had been slain.

289
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,500
Behowl to see the marvel.

290
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,000
When Hrothgar arrived at the hall,

291
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
he spoke.

292
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
May the gods be thanked for you, Beowulf.

293
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The deed you have done this night

294
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
makes you mighty above all heroes.

295
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Often have I rewarded lesser deeds

296
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
with great gifts.

297
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
To you I can deny nothing.

298
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Hail to you, Beowulf.

299
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Beowulf.

300
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Beowulf.

301
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Beowulf.

302
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Son of Eggbeard, all said.

303
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We have gone through with a glorious endeavor

304
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
and been much favored in this fight

305
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
we dared against the unknown.

306
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Nevertheless,

307
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
if you could have seen the monster himself,

308
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
where he lay beaten,

309
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I would have been better pleased.

310
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
My plan was to pounce,

311
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
pin him down in a tight grip

312
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and grapple him to death,

313
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
have him panting for life,

314
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
powerless and clasped in my bare hands,

315
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
his body in thrall.

316
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
But I couldn't stop him from slipping my hold.

317
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The Lord allowed it.

318
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
My lock on him wasn't strong enough.

319
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
He struggled fiercely and broke and ran.

320
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yet he bought his freedom at a high price

321
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
for he left his hand and arm and shoulder

322
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
to show he'd been here,

323
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
a cold comfort for having come among us.

324
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And now he won't be long for this world.

325
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
He's done his worst,

326
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
but the wound will end him.

327
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
He is hasped and hooped and harpling with pain,

328
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
limping and looped in it,

329
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
like a man outlawed for wickedness.

330
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
He must await the mighty judgment of God in majesty.

331
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Then Halfdane's son presented Beowulf

332
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
with a gold standard as a victory gift,

333
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
an embroidered banner,

334
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
also breast mail and a helmet.

335
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
And a sword carried high

336
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that was both precious object and token of honor.

337
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Come now to a banquet.

338
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We'll celebrate with song,

339
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
old tales of victory.

340
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So Beowulf drank his drink at ease.

341
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It was hardly a shame to be showered with such gifts

342
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
in front of the hall troops.

343
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They sang then and played to please the hero,

344
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
words and music for their warrior prince,

345
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
harp tunes and tales of adventure.

346
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
There were high times on the hall benches,

347
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and the king's poet performed his part

348
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
with the saga of Finn and his sons,

349
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
unfolding the tale of that fierce attack in Friesland

350
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
when Gnaf, king of the Danes, met death

351
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and his sister Hildibur suffered cruelly.

352
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Son and brother, she lost them both on the battlefield.

353
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
They foredoomed, cut down and spear-gored.

354
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
She, in shock, waylaid by grief, Hock's daughter.

355
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
How could she not lament her fate when morning came

356
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
and the light broke on her murdered dears?

357
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So a truce was offered as follows.

358
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
First, separate quarters to be cleared for the Danes,

359
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
hall and throne to be shared with the Frisians.

360
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
With oaths to Hengist, Finn swore openly, solemnly,

361
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
that the battle survivors would be guaranteed honour and status.

362
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No infringement by word or deed, no provocation would be permitted.

363
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Their own ring-giver was dead and gone.

364
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
They were leaderless, in forced allegiance to his murderer.

365
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
A funeral pyre was then prepared.

366
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Effulgent gold brought out from the hoard.

367
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
The pride and prince of the shieldings lay awaiting the flame.

368
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Then Hildibur ordered her own son's body to be burnt with Gnafs,

369
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
the flesh on his bones to sputter and blaze beside his uncle's.

370
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The woman wailed and sang keens.

371
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The warrior went up. Carcass flame swirled and fumed.

372
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
They stood round the burial mound and howled as heads melted,

373
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
crusted gashes spattered and ran bloody matter.

374
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Warriors scattered to homes and forts all over Friesland.

375
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Hengist stayed, lived out that whole resentful, blood-sullen winter with Finn,

376
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
homesick and helpless.

377
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Then winter was gone. Earth's lap grew lovely.

378
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Longing woke in the cooped-up exile for a voyage home,

379
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
but more for vengeance, some way of bringing things to a head.

380
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
His sword-arm hankered to greet the dudes.

381
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Thus blood was spilled, the gallant Finn slain in his home.

382
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
The wildness in them had to brim over.

383
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
The hall ran red with blood of enemies.

384
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Finn was cut down, the queen brought away,

385
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
everything the shieldings could find inside Finn's walls.

386
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
The Frisian king's gold collars and gemstones swept off to the ship.

387
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Over sea lanes then, back to Daneland,

388
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
the warrior troop bore that lady home.

389
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The poem was over. The poet had performed.

390
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
A pleasant murmur started on the benches.

391
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The stewards did the rounds with wine and splendid jugs.

392
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The queen spoke to Hrothgar.

393
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Herod is cleansed. The ring hall bright again.

394
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So, give while you may, generous lord, great rewards.

395
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
She turned then to the bench where her boys sat, all the youth together.

396
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And that good man, Beowulf the Geat, sat between the brothers.

397
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The cup was carried to him, kind words spoken and welcomed,

398
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
and a wealth of gold given to the hero.

399
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Two arm bangles, a male shirt and rings,

400
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and the most resplendent torc of gold I ever heard tell of

401
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
anywhere on earth or under heaven.

402
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Then the queen pronounced, in the presence of the company,

403
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Cymher di a gem hareth hwn.

404
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Fanwyl, Beowulf.

405
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Take joy.



1
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,600
In this fair jewel, dear Beowulf.

2
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,280
Men were drinking wine at that rare feast.

3
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,320
How could they know fate, the grim shape of things to come?

4
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:22,959
Then it became known to all men, another deadly foe, Dark Spirit, survived within those foul

5
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,959
depths.

6
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:28,280
A loathsome creature living to avenge.

7
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,959
The threat looming over many thanes as night approached, and King Hrothgar prepared to

8
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:36,080
retire to his quarters.

9
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,320
Save mam, Grendel!

10
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,520
Buistvill and Galarri a mi marb marro.

11
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:51,000
Grendel's mother, a she-monster, grieving for her dead son.

12
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,279
Monstrous hellbride, brooded on her wrongs.

13
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,040
She sought her recompense.

14
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:04,000
She had been forced down into fearful waters, the cold depths, but now sullied forth on

15
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,720
a savage journey.

16
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,000
She descended on Harroch, and fate swept on its wheel when the mother of Grendel found

17
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,820
her way among those men.

18
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,360
She grasped a man quickly.

19
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,239
The king's good friend, Ashera, clutched him to herself and was away to the fen.

20
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,919
Beowulf was not there.

21
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,800
Harroch was in uproar.

22
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,680
Grendel's hand had gone with her!

23
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,400
And the old lord, the grey-haired warrior, was heart-sore and weary when he heard the

24
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,839
news.

25
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:44,400
His highest-placed advisor, his dearest companion, was dead and gone.

26
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,959
Beowulf was soon summoned to the chamber, victory-blessed man, and that valiant warrior

27
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,360
came with his following.

28
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,959
It was at first light, captain of his company, to where the king waited to see if by some

29
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:02,440
means the swayer of all would work a turning into this tale of sorrow.

30
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,000
The man, excellent in warfare, walked across the hall, flanked by his escort.

31
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,720
The floor timbers boomed to make his addresses to the Danish lord.

32
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,479
Ashera is lost, lifted from his bed.

33
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:26,080
My wisest friend, when the robber Grendel roamed at will, gorging on my men, some glimpsed

34
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:34,559
another, not one but two dark wanderers, wending through the mists, and one in woman's shape.

35
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:40,600
Few miles from here, a frost-stiffened wood waits and keeps watch above a mirror.

36
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,759
At night there, something uncanny happens.

37
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:49,600
The water burns, and the mere bottom has never been sounded by the sons of men.

38
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,520
Now help depends again on you, and on you alone.

39
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,160
The gap of danger where the demon waits is still unknown to you.

40
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,919
Seek it if you dare.

41
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:04,320
Beowulf, the son of Edgthil, spoke.

42
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,080
Why, sir, do not grieve.

43
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,199
It is always better to avenge, dear ones, than to indulge in mourning.

44
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:24,880
It is always better to avenge, dear ones, than to indulge in mourning.

45
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:35,600
For every one of us, living in this world means waiting for our end.

46
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:45,039
Let whoever can win glory before death.

47
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,839
When a warrior is gone, that will be his best and only bulwark.

48
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:55,160
So arise, my lord, and let us immediately set forth on the trail of this troll dam.

49
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,520
I guarantee you she will not get away, not to dens underground, nor upland groves, nor

50
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,559
the ocean floor.

51
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,360
She'll have nowhere to flee to.

52
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,880
Endure your troubles today.

53
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,000
Bear up, and be the man I expect you to be.

54
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,160
With that, the old lord sprang to his feet, and praised God for Beowulf's pledge.

55
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:24,600
The wise king mounted the royal saddle, and rode out in style with a force of shield-bearers.

56
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,640
Up fells and screes, along narrow footpaths, and ways where they were forced into single

57
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:34,760
file, and suddenly discovered the dismal wood.

58
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,079
The bloodshot water surged underneath.

59
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,640
Bitter distress was to be endured by the Danes who were there, a grief for the earls, for

60
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,799
every thane of the friends of the shieldings, when they found there the head of Asherah

61
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:52,799
by the edge of the cliff.

62
00:34:52,799 --> 00:35:01,799
The next eruption from the demonic, chthonic, watery depths of the Mir was to the early

63
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:08,200
medieval mind, and maybe to us still too, even more threatening, because it was female.

64
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,640
Everybody gazed as the hot gore kept wallowing up, and an urgent war-horn repeated its notes.

65
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,880
The water was infested, there were writhing sea-dragons, and monsters slouching on slopes

66
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:26,000
by the cliff, serpents and wild things, down they plunged, lashing in anger at the loud

67
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,959
call of the battle bugle.

68
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:34,440
Grendel's mother may be fearsome, but she still feels a mother's bond to her child.

69
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,559
And to the poet, that's even a source of imaginative sympathy.

70
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:45,760
It makes her more than just a scary monster, she's a perverse mirror to mankind.

71
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,720
The geat put on the armor of a hero, unanxious for his life.

72
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,320
The manufacturer of the male shirt, figured and vast, that must venture in the deep, made

73
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,040
it such a bulwark to his bone-framed chest, that the savage attack of an incensed enemy

74
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,079
could do no harm to the heart within it.

75
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:10,040
His head was encircled by a silver helmet, that was to strike down through the swirl

76
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,440
of water, disturb the depths.

77
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,760
Adorned with treasure, clasped with royal bands, it was right as at first, when the

78
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,119
weaponsmith had wonderfully made it, so that no sword should afterward be able to cut through

79
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:28,000
the defending wild boars that faced about it.

80
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,200
And another item, lent by Unferth, a rare and ancient sword, named Grunting.

81
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,040
The iron blade, with its ill-boding patterns, had been tempered in blood.

82
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,440
It had never failed the hand of anyone who hefted it in battle.

83
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,000
The Anglo-Saxons believed in the reality of supernatural forces, that could only be defeated

84
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,320
by magic, whether by the cross of the saintly exorcist, or by the sword of the hero.

85
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Beowulf, son of Edgthor, spoke.

86
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,040
Wisest of kings, now that I have come to the point of action, I ask you to recall what

87
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,480
we said earlier, that you, son of Halfdane and gold friend to retainers, that you, if

88
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,519
I should fall and suffer death while serving your cause, would act like a father to me

89
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,359
afterwards.

90
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:22,720
If this combat kills me, take care of my young company, my comrades-in-arms, and be sure

91
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,200
also, my beloved Horthgar, to send Helag the treasures I received.

92
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,519
Let the Lord of the Geats gaze on that gold, let Hrethil's son take note of it and see

93
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:39,079
that I found a ring-giver of rare magnificence, and enjoyed the good of his generosity.

94
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:41,799
An unfairth is to have what I inherited.

95
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:47,600
To that far-famed man I bequeath my own sharp-horned, wave-sheened wonder-blade.

96
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,959
With hunting, I shall gain glory, or die.

97
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:56,839
Without further ado, he dived into the heaving depths of the lake.

98
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:05,239
It was the best part of a day, before he could see the solid bottom.

99
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:15,480
Grim and greedy, the guardian of the waters that kept her hundred winters watch.

100
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,959
The hero observed that swamp-thing from hell, the Tarnhag, in all her terrible strength,

101
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:24,839
then heaved his war-sword and swung his arm.

102
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:29,079
The decorated blade came down, ringing and singing on her head.

103
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:34,039
But he soon found the shining blade refused to bite.

104
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:38,020
The fabulous powers of that heirloom failed.

105
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,119
He would have to rely on the might of his arm.

106
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,760
A man must act so when he means in a fight to frame himself a long-lasting glory.

107
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,919
It is not life he thinks of.

108
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:52,840
The Geat prince went for Grendel's mother, seized her by the shoulder.

109
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,159
He was not sorry to be fighting his mortal foe.

110
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,280
And with mounting anger, the man, hard in battle, hurled her to the ground.

111
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,719
She promptly repaid this present of his, as her ruthless hands reached out for him.

112
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,760
And the strongest of fighting men stumbled in his weariness.

113
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,080
The firmest of foot-warriors fell to the earth.

114
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,159
She was down on this guest of hers, and had drawn her knife broad, burnished of edge,

115
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:23,520
for her boy was to be avenged, her only son.

116
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,479
Overspreading his back, the shirt of mail shielded his life then, barred the entry to

117
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,479
edge and point.

118
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:36,239
Which Theow's son would have ended his venture deep underground there, the Geat fighter,

119
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:41,520
had not the battle-shirt then brought him aid, his war-shirt of steel.

120
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,919
The ruler of the heavens rightly settled it as soon as the Geat regained his feet.

121
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:54,080
Then he saw, among the armor on the wall, a giant sword from former days.

122
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:59,760
This wonder was so enormous that no other man would be equal to bearing it in battle-play.

123
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,159
It was a giant's forge that had fashioned it so well.

124
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:09,599
The Geat champion, shaking now with war-rage, caught it by the rich hilt, and careless of

125
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,760
his life, brandished his circles and brought it down in fury, the catcher full and fairly

126
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,520
biting into the neck.

127
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:27,400
The blade sheared through the backbone, the sword was gory, he was glad at the deed.

128
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,760
The seafarer's leader made for land, resolutely swimming, delighted with his prize.

129
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,960
His thanes advanced in a troupe to meet him, thanking God and taking great delight in seeing

130
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,440
their prince back safe and sound.

131
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,039
With high hearts they headed away along footpaths and trails through the fields.

132
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:56,640
It was a task for four to hoist Grendel's head on a spear and bear it under a strain

133
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:59,719
to the bright hall.

134
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:03,400
Beowulf, son of Edstil, spoke.

135
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:10,599
So, son of Halfdane, Prince of the Shieldings, we are glad to bring this booty from the lake.

136
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:14,440
It is a token of triumph and we tender it to you.

137
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,960
I barely survived the battle underwater.

138
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,719
It was hard-fought, a desperate affair that could have gone badly.

139
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,159
If God had not helped me, the outcome would have been quick and fatal.

140
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:31,960
I have wrested the hilt from the enemy's hand, avenged the evil done to the Danes.

141
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,239
It is what was due, and this I pledge.

142
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:42,479
O Prince of the Shieldings, you can sleep secure with your company of troops in here at all.

143
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:49,119
Never need you fear for a single thane of your scept or nation, young warriors or old.

144
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,799
That laying waste of life that you and your people endured of yore.

145
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:57,359
Then the golden hilt was handed over to the Old Lord,

146
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,320
a relic from long ago for the venerable ruler.

147
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,960
Then Halfdane's son presented Beowulf with a gold standard as a victory gift,

148
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,559
an embroidered banner, also breast mail, and a helmet and a sword carried high

149
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:18,760
that was both precious object and token of honour.

150
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,520
And soon all was restored, the same as before.

151
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,679
Darkness came back, the hall was thronged, and a banquet set forth.

152
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,679
Black night fell and covered them in darkness.

153
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:35,760
Then the company rose for the old campaigner.

154
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,039
The grey-haired prince was ready for bed.

155
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:43,440
And a need for rest came over the brave shield-bearing geat.

156
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,479
The hall towered, gold shingled and gabled, and the guests slept in it,

157
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:54,479
until the black raven with raucous glee announced heaven's joy,

158
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:57,880
and a hurry of brightness overran the shadows.

159
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,559
Warriors rose quickly, impatient to be off.

160
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:05,039
The undaunted hero addressed Hrothgar.

161
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:11,000
Now we who cross the wide sea have to inform you that we feel a desire to return to Helac.

162
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,599
Here we have been welcomed and thoroughly entertained. You have treated us well.

163
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:18,840
If there is any favour on earth I can perform beyond deeds of arms I have done already,

164
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:24,280
or anything that would merit your affections more, I shall act, my lord, with alacrity.

165
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,599
If ever I hear from across the ocean that people on your borders are threatening battle,

166
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:31,080
as attackers have done from time to time,

167
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,400
I shall land with a thousand thanes at my back to help your cause.

168
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,400
Helac may be young to rule a nation, but this much I know about the King of the Geats.

169
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,200
He will come to my aid and want to support me by word and action in your hour of need,

170
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,880
when honour dictates that I raise a hedge of spears around you.

171
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,159
The one who upholds justice and truth in the land, ruling as long as many can remember,

172
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,960
may indeed say this.

173
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:20,080
He was born to be the best of men, most dear Beowulf.

174
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:26,200
And so the good and grey-haired Dane, that high-born king, kissed Beowulf and embraced

175
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,679
his neck, then broke down in sudden tears.

176
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:38,039
The embrace ended, and Beowulf, glorious in his gold regalia, stepped the green earth.

177
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:43,159
Straining at anchor and ready for boarding, his boat awaited him.

178
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:49,280
Sail-ropes were tightened, timbers drummed, and stiff winds kept the wave-crosser skimming

179
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,280
ahead.

180
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:57,559
As she heaved forward, her foamy neck was fleet and buoyant, a lapped prow loping over

181
00:44:57,559 --> 00:44:58,559
currents.

182
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,359
Hwylio d'llong gan dorri trwy'r dwr a gadail tyr Denmark.

183
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:10,080
Swift sailed the boat, dividing the waves, left the land of Denmark, returned to Hugallach's

184
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,080
kingdom.

185
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,400
Beowulf's return was reported to Hugallach as soon as possible, news that the captain

186
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,400
was now in the enclosure, his battle-brother back from the fray, alive and well, walking

187
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,280
to the hall.

188
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,919
A decision was quickly made on the king's orders, and the troops filed across the cleared

189
00:45:30,919 --> 00:45:32,200
floor.

190
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,119
He hankered to know every tale the sea-geats had to tell.

191
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,599
He had been poorly regarded for a long time, was taken by the geats for less than he was

192
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:43,599
worth.

193
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:50,559
They firmly believed that he lacked force, that the prince was a weakling, but presently

194
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:54,039
every affront to his deserving was reversed.

195
00:45:54,799 --> 00:46:06,679
Þa nwylaf Beowulf, rydw i yn rhoi i ti ystad o saith mil o wyrtheg, yr orsedd hon a neuadh

196
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:13,239
yr orain y tyr, yn haeddu clod cyfran daelwng o iar.

197
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:21,359
I bestow on you an estate of seven thousand cattle, this princely throne, and a hall greatest

198
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:27,559
in the land, gloriously decked, worthy of praise, the portion of an earl.

199
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:39,559
A lot was to happen in later days, in the fury of battle.

200
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:46,679
Hielac fell, and the shelter of Heardred's shield proved useless against the fierce aggression

201
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,880
of the Shilfings.

202
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:57,599
The wide kingdom reverted to Beowulf.

203
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:17,800
He ruled it well for fifty winters, grew old and wise as warden of the land.

204
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:24,560
Fifty winters of north wind, a smorgasbord of words for snow, shackled ice, stalactite,

205
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,439
stalagmite, Beowulf ruled his wide realm.

206
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:34,680
Beard wintered with wisdom, bonecage large with gravitas, our hero held his homeland

207
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:43,160
till, one dark and starstruck night, where the earth surges up, up, grassing and greenscaping

208
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:51,479
A steep stone-bouldered barrow, burial ground, a dragon stirred.

209
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:58,319
Guardian of glistening, glamorous gold, as yellow as black gold, crude oil, extracted

210
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:05,800
from earth and murky sea, is black, and jewels, winking wealth, as mirrored, multifaceted

211
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,719
as dragon is extravagantly green.

212
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:12,880
What use have the dead for precious gems?

213
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,079
What use has a beast for a treasure chest, except the glamour, the glimmer, the glow

214
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,079
that lights the gloom of the hollow cave?

215
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:28,040
Dragon guarded the treasure trove of a long lost tribe, as dragons, masculine, feminine

216
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,400
and neuter, protect their progeny from predators.

217
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,760
When someone on the run stumbled across the den, and accidentally on purpose purloined

218
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:47,160
a jewelled cup, since money manacles man's mindscape, then, sensing evil, fled in terror,

219
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:53,640
the green minder of Mother Earth, fauna and flora, flared up.

220
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:59,599
Do not disturb the habitat of the wordworm, the wild one, for when a dumb beast speaks,

221
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:05,479
they speak the sparkiest sibilance, spit a split-tongued truth.

222
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,560
Let sleeping dragons lie.

223
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:13,920
Three hundred winters of white words, dragonhood ruled their ring hoard, till the thief disturbed

224
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,239
the treasure trove, and made haste to inform his master, his lord, who ordered the den

225
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:25,359
be looted, the gleam of greed in his eyes, and a pardon granted the absconder, who wreaked

226
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,680
the worst with that first theft.

227
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:36,160
When dragon stirred, life stood still.

228
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,560
The serpent sensed homo sapiens, scanned the thief's physical footprint, evidence the

229
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,359
enemy had entered.

230
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:48,239
The horde guardian scoured the ground, inside and outside, over and under, desperate to

231
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:50,319
discover the intruder.

232
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:56,400
Flesh famished and bloodthirsty, encircled the cave to catch the coward, but nothing,

233
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,640
no one.

234
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:05,680
Black in the barrow, hollow and dark as a howl, sought the gold cup, discovered it,

235
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,199
gone.

236
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:13,959
The sun was slow to sink on the sea, and with each hour, the heat heightened, every second

237
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:20,680
incendiary, until darkness fell, and the fire of rage boiled in the breast of the barrow

238
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,680
beast.

239
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,199
For the theft of a cup, revenge erupted.

240
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,239
The dragon took off in a frenzy of flames, scarring their name on the panorama.

241
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:37,079
Terror gripped the earthscape, grief engulfed the heart of the Gaiats.

242
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:44,680
So begins the end of the son of Edsthael, the brave, unassailable Beowulf.

243
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:52,160
The fire-spitter spewed a word-horde, inflammatory invocation, hated, heated, and hunted, burning

244
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,959
the burnished buildings and punishing the populace.

245
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:03,839
Here, there, dragon waged war, but before the east orb opened its eye, they retreated

246
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:10,160
to the banked barrow, the dark den of death, lit by the glittering, glistening jewels they

247
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,680
guarded like golden eggs.

248
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:22,400
Then Beowulf heard the murmurs, no-smoke-without-fire rumours, his own home, high throne, haven,

249
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:30,640
hearth of Hygge, safe space, say it though the truth thickens your throat, had blazed

250
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,760
in waves of flames.

251
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,760
Fire-dragon gone on the rampage on the ramparts, it hit home in his heartbeat.

252
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,760
Was it weird?

253
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,760
What must be?

254
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,280
What had he done to earn the sentence of God, the great creator?

255
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:55,239
Beowulf, not himself, shipwrecked by self-doubt, doom-ravaged, declared revenge.

256
00:51:55,239 --> 00:52:00,640
The leader of the geats ordered a war-shield, fashioned from iron, impervious to fire, as

257
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,079
woods from the woods would smoulder, combust.

258
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:10,359
Time and weird were winding thin for the proud protector of the populace, and the serpent,

259
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:14,280
though he'd shielded his horde three hundred hibernations.

260
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,880
Beowulf, the prince of rings, resisted charging the dragon with a large army.

261
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,959
He was not afraid of the fire-flayer, our protagonist, who'd done in, finished men,

262
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:31,359
Grendel and Grendel's mother, the human, the superhuman.

263
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:38,680
He'd battled, attacked and ransacked, witnessed grief, loss of life every which way, yet remained

264
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,599
brave.

265
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:48,040
Today he would face his ultimate fate, weird in the form of the wordworm, his nemesis,

266
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,560
the serpent.

267
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:55,040
Beowulf took just twelve men on his final fight with the fire-spitter, including the

268
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:00,000
culprit who'd plundered the cup, spurring the dragon's extravagant wrath.

269
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,199
This thirteenth man, this unlucky thief, was afraid to revisit the dragon's den, but only

270
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:12,199
he knew the secluded route to the underground den, the stone hall near the crashing, thrashing

271
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:14,119
sortscape.

272
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:19,439
Take a glimpse at the gleaming gems, the showy stones of the treasure trove, you'll need

273
00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:23,719
guts to try to retrieve them.

274
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:30,000
Beowulf the king, ring-giver of the geats, seated on the cape with a heavy care, wished

275
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,959
his hearth-men good health and heart, hid his low mood, impending doom drawing nearer

276
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:40,040
and nearer to our hero.

277
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:47,680
Soon his body and soul would fork, his lifespan end, his life-spirit take wing from his bone

278
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,680
bondage.

279
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:56,560
As images flitted from his former life, seven years old, fostered by Threthil in the royal

280
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:04,040
court, in awe of his kinship, the glitter of gems, the fire of feasts, an arrow pierced

281
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:12,439
in Harrowbield's chest, freak accident, brother killed brother, war between Swedes and geats,

282
00:54:12,439 --> 00:54:17,479
the shining sword and precious treasure honoured to him by Heorlach.

283
00:54:17,479 --> 00:54:21,359
Beowulf, son of Eddsthael, said,

284
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:28,479
At the blade's edge, of this tested weapon, this named slayer, Naegling, this hard sword,

285
00:54:28,479 --> 00:54:31,599
I'll recover the treasure.

286
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:40,439
When I was young, I fought tough and survived, now I am old, I'll prove bolder, conquer this

287
00:54:40,439 --> 00:54:48,400
dragon fiend, for the glory of god, if it dares to surface, face me in combat.

288
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:57,880
A simple chainmail, shield and sword, no boyish boasts or wise words, I'll face my rival.

289
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:05,079
This is no knuckle fight with Grendel or his vengeful Virago, this is a fight against fire.

290
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:15,079
I will not shift a foot, I will trust that fate, weird divine will, must decide who'll win.

291
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:21,959
Wait here on the barrow, safe in your war gear, to see which of us bears our wounds best,

292
00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:26,400
who gives in first, who holds out last.

293
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:35,199
It's my rite of passage, my battle alone, either gleaming gold or grimacing death.

294
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:41,359
From the dragon's den, a stream rippled with flickering flames from the dragon's breath.

295
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:45,040
Who could confront that heat?

296
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:52,199
Behold Beowulf, wizened warrior, greying with greatness, king of the geats, hero in armour

297
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:57,680
and shimmering shield, revealing the gleaming edge of his sword, the ancient heirloom named

298
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,040
Nageling.

299
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:07,520
He let one word burst from his core, a battle cry that boomed in the barrow, ricocheted

300
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,319
off the grey stone cave.

301
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:19,439
And his nemesis, the antagonist, fire starter, flame spitter, eco-hero, echoed back an earth-shattering,

302
00:56:19,439 --> 00:56:23,719
earth-dragon roar of flame, smoke and steam.

303
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:31,520
Snaked out of the cave, uncoiled, fifty foot long, scaled and scalding, gold guardian,

304
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,239
glittering green.

305
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:37,920
Behold the beauty of the beast.

306
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,880
Horrified, they mirrored each other.

307
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,920
Then the creature coiled and collided with Beowulf's shield.

308
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,560
It held out, but not as long as he longed for it, and when he raised his hand to attack

309
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:56,880
his fierce and fiery nemesis, the cutting edge of the legendary sword failed on the

310
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,479
bony scales.

311
00:56:59,479 --> 00:57:03,400
Played the wrong tune for a warrior in the heat of battle.

312
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:10,079
The barrow-beast incensed an incendiary spat-back of barrage of battle-bites, and the son of

313
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:17,239
Ed Sao took umbrage, but sprang back, gave ground against his will, as we must all one

314
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:21,880
day concede the final defeat.

315
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,719
But the fight is not over yet.

316
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:29,479
These two enemies, twinned by fate, clashed once more.

317
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:34,959
The wordworm took a deep breath, spewed a firestorm, and Beowulf was trapped in a ring

318
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:39,000
of fire, he who had once freed his people.

319
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,959
His men, armoured, weaponed and trained, did not advance, brave and warlike, to save their

320
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,959
lord.

321
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:49,520
They fled to the forest, to save their own skin.

322
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,359
Except for one, known as Wiglaf, son of Weirstann.

323
00:57:54,359 --> 00:58:00,079
He couldn't desert his worthy lord, remembering the rings and rewards brave Beowulf had bestowed

324
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,959
upon him.

325
00:58:01,959 --> 00:58:08,839
His hand grasping his shield and sword, Wiglaf cursed his cowardly companions.

326
00:58:08,839 --> 00:58:12,959
Remember the promises we made in the beer hall to Beowulf, how we pledged allegiance

327
00:58:12,959 --> 00:58:14,800
for this bloodshed.

328
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,719
And though he swore on his ancient sword to go it alone, I would rather allow the flames

329
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:26,599
to burn my bulky body to ashes, alongside my lavish lord, than desert him now.

330
00:58:26,599 --> 00:58:32,040
With that, he hurried through the seething fumes to meet his leader, with these words.

331
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,760
Lord, I will support you.

332
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,920
Hearing those words, the wordworm exploded with expletives.

333
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,119
The fire flame swelled in waves and charred Wiglaf's shield to a cinder.

334
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,599
His metal armor would not save him, only his king's shield conserved him.

335
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:59,920
But now, recalling his past advantage, his legendary epic strength, Beowulf wielded his

336
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:08,479
battle blade with such power, it stuck in the skull of the winged one, niggling shattered.

337
00:59:08,479 --> 00:59:15,479
Such was Beowulf's brute force, too superhuman for sword or shield.

338
00:59:15,479 --> 00:59:22,280
Then, for the third and final time, the firestarter, feeling his life force threatened, lunged

339
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:29,040
towards Beowulf, fierce and bloodthirsty, bit him in the neck with his bitter jaws.

340
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,359
Beowulf bled, mortally wounded.

341
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:35,520
His lifeblood flowed like lava.

342
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,619
But Wiglaf remained brave and faithful, although his battling hand was burned.

343
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:46,459
With his sword studded and bloodstained, he struck at the dragon, lower down, and the

344
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:50,380
fire began to beat back.

345
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:59,020
Then Beowulf, bloody, brave and bright-eyed, saw in that split second a lifeline.

346
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,020
He drew the sharp knife.



1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,320
he wore in his armour and plunged it into the dragon's gut.

2
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:16,559
The fatal thrust that snuffed out the flame spitter, and they fell, extinguished, earthed,

3
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,980
extinct.

4
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:26,040
These two men together, twinned warriors, had finally brought the dragon down.

5
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:33,959
Big Love honoured the eleventh hour, but for Beowulf, it was his final win.

6
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:42,759
His fate, his weird, his fatal wound, mirrored the doom of the wordworm.

7
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:48,119
So Daring drove out life.

8
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:59,000
Then the wound, dealt by the ground-burner earlier, began to scald and swell.

9
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,959
Beowulf discovered deadly poison suppurating inside him, surges of nausea.

10
01:01:04,959 --> 01:01:09,680
And the king saw the last triumph of his works in the world.

11
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:17,559
Wiglaf took water and washed his good lord, bathed away battle-blood, loosened his helmet.

12
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:23,919
Beowulf spoke, in spite of his wounds, for he well knew his days in the world had been

13
01:01:23,919 --> 01:01:26,120
lived out to the end.

14
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:34,800
His allotted time was drawing to a close.

15
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,800
Death was very near.

16
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:55,559
Now was the time when I would have wanted to bestow this armour on my own son.

17
01:01:55,559 --> 01:02:00,559
Had it been my fortune to have fathered an heir and live on in his flesh.

18
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:04,559
For fifty years I ruled this nation.

19
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,559
No king of any neighbouring clan would dare face me with troops.

20
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,559
None had the power to intimidate me.

21
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,559
I stood my ground and took what came.

22
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:20,559
Cared for things in my keeping.

23
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,559
Never fermented quarrels.

24
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,559
Never swore to a lie.

25
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,559
All this consoles me.

26
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:32,559
Go now, quickly, dearest Wiglaf.

27
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,559
Under the grey stone where the dragon is laid out, lost his treasure.

28
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,559
Hurry to feast your eyes on the horde.

29
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:41,559
Away you go.

30
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:44,559
I want to examine the ancient gold.

31
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,559
Gaze my fill on those garnered jewels.

32
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:51,559
My going will be easier for having seen the treasure.

33
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:57,559
A less troubled letting go of the life and lordship I have long maintained.

34
01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:03,559
Straight away, as I have heard, the son of Wayokstan obeyed his wounded lord, weak from the struggle.

35
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:10,559
Following these words, he went in his ringcoat, his broidered battle tunic, under the barrow's roof.

36
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,559
Traversing the ledge to the treasure house of jewels,

37
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:19,559
the valiant young thane was thrilled by the sight of the gold gleaming on the ground where it lay.

38
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:25,559
The devices along the wall and the den of the serpent, winger of the darkness.

39
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:32,559
Drinking cups stood there, the unburnished vessels of a vanished race, their ornaments awry.

40
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:38,559
Rusty helmets all eaten away, armbands everywhere artfully wrought.

41
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:46,559
How easily treasure, buried in the ground, gold-hidden however skilfully, can escape from any man.

42
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,559
Wiglaf went quickly, keen to get back.

43
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:58,559
He was hoping he would find the leader of the geats alive where he had left him, helpless, earlier, on the open ground.

44
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:07,559
So he came to the place, carrying the treasure, and found his lord bleeding profusely, his life at an end.

45
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:12,559
The old lord gazed sadly at the gold.

46
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,559
To the everlasting lord of all.

47
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:21,559
To the king of glory I give thanks that I behold this treasure here in front of me.

48
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:27,559
That I have been allowed to leave my people so well endowed on the day I die.

49
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:36,559
Now that I have bartered my last breath to own this fortune, it is up to you to look after their needs.

50
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,559
I can hold out no longer.

51
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:46,559
Order my troop to construct a barrow on a headland on the coast after my pirates cooled.

52
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:57,559
So that in coming times, crews under sail will call it Beowulf's Barrow, as they steer ships across the wide and shrouded waters.

53
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:04,559
The Anglo-Saxons had a vivid sense of living in an old landscape,

54
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:10,559
with prehistoric long barrows and standing stones all around them.

55
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:16,559
The great stone circles to their poets were the work of giants,

56
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,559
wondrous work of wall stones,

57
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:22,559
wondrous work of wall stones.

58
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:28,559
And the ancient stone age burial mounds were heathen burials,

59
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:34,559
places where the ancestral treasures were stored up and guarded by dragons.

60
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:43,559
Then the king, in his great heartedness, unclasped the collar of gold from his neck and gave it to his young thane,

61
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:48,559
telling him to use it and the war shirt and the gilded helmet.

62
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,559
You're the last of us.

63
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:55,559
The only one left of the weighmundings.

64
01:05:55,559 --> 01:06:04,559
Fate swept us away, sent my whole brave highborn clan to their final doom.

65
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:09,559
Now, I must follow.

66
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:12,559
That was the warrior's last word.

67
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:17,559
That was the warrior's last word.

68
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,559
He had no more to confide.

69
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:30,559
His soul fled from his breast to its destined place among the steadfast ones.

70
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:41,559
The king had indeed met with a marvelous death.

71
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:50,559
It was hard then on the young hero, having to watch the one he held so dear there on the ground going through his death agony.

72
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:56,559
The dragon from under earth, his nightmarish destroyer, lay destroyed as well.

73
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:04,559
Never again would he glitter and glide and show himself off in the midnight air, exulting in his riches.

74
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,559
He fell to earth through the battle strength in Beowulf's arm.

75
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:16,559
The treasure had been won, bought and paid for by Beowulf's death.

76
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:21,559
Both had reached the end of the road through the life they had been lent.

77
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:28,559
It was not long then till they budged from the wood, the battleshirkers, ten of them together,

78
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:35,559
those traitors and weaklings who had not dared deploy their spears in their own lord's extreme need.

79
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:41,559
They bore their shields ashamedly, their armor of war, to where the old man lay.

80
01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:44,559
They regarded Wiglaf.

81
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,559
Wearily he sat, a good soldier, at the shoulder of his lord.

82
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:52,559
Wiglaf spoke, Weachstan's offspring.

83
01:07:52,559 --> 01:08:00,559
Beowulf had little cause to brag about his armed guard, yet I found new strength welling up when I went to help him.

84
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,559
Then my sword connected, and the deadly assaults of our foe grew weaker.

85
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,559
The fire coursed less strongly from his head.

86
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:14,559
But when the worst happened, too few rallied around the prince.

87
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,559
So it is goodbye now to all you know and love on your home ground.

88
01:08:19,559 --> 01:08:23,559
The open-handedness, the giving of war swords.

89
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:32,559
Our whole nation will be dispossessed once princes from beyond get tidings of how you turned and fled and disgraced yourselves.

90
01:08:32,559 --> 01:08:37,559
A warrior will die sooner than live a life of shame.

91
01:08:37,559 --> 01:08:43,559
He bade that the combat's result be proclaimed in the city over the brow of the headland.

92
01:08:43,559 --> 01:08:51,559
Now the people's pride and love, the lord of the geats, is laid on his deathbed, brought down by the dragon's attack.

93
01:08:52,559 --> 01:08:55,559
Now war is looming over our nation.

94
01:08:55,559 --> 01:09:01,559
Soon it will be known to Franks and Frisians, far and wide, that the king is gone.

95
01:09:01,559 --> 01:09:06,559
Nor do I expect peace or pact-keeping of any sort from the Swedes.

96
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:10,559
This vicious feud, I am convinced, is bound to revive.

97
01:09:10,559 --> 01:09:15,559
They will cross our borders and attack in force when they find out that Beowulf is dead.

98
01:09:15,559 --> 01:09:20,559
His royal pyre will melt no small amount of gold.

99
01:09:20,559 --> 01:09:24,559
Heaped there in a horde, it was bought at heavy cost.

100
01:09:24,559 --> 01:09:33,559
And that pile of rings he paid for at the end with his own life will go up with the flame, be furled in fire.

101
01:09:33,559 --> 01:09:37,559
Treasure no follower will wear in his memory.

102
01:09:41,559 --> 01:09:43,559
The warband arose.

103
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:49,559
They went unhappily under Arnanus to look on the wonder with welling tears.

104
01:09:49,559 --> 01:09:54,559
They found him on the sand, his soul fled, keeping his resting place.

105
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:57,559
Rings he had given them in former times.

106
01:09:57,559 --> 01:10:05,559
But the final day had come for the champion, and the chief of the geats, the warrior king, had met his wondrous death.

107
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:13,559
Stranger the creature they encountered first in the level place, the loathsome worm stretched out opposite.

108
01:10:13,559 --> 01:10:21,559
Scorched by its own flames lay the fire drake in its fatal markings, and it measured fifty feet as it lay.

109
01:10:21,559 --> 01:10:29,559
He had once been master of the midnight air, held sweet sway there, and swooped down again to seek his den.

110
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:37,559
Standing by him there were bowls and flagons, there were platters lying there, and precious swords quite rusted through,

111
01:10:37,559 --> 01:10:41,559
as they had rested there a thousand winters in the womb of earth.

112
01:10:41,559 --> 01:10:44,559
Wiglaf spoke Werkstern's son.

113
01:10:44,559 --> 01:10:49,559
Often, when one man follows his own will, many are hurt.

114
01:10:49,559 --> 01:10:51,559
This happened to us.

115
01:10:51,559 --> 01:11:00,559
Nothing we advised could ever convince the lord we loved, our land's guardian, not to aggravate the keeper of the gold.

116
01:11:00,559 --> 01:11:07,559
Let him lie where he was long accustomed, lurk there under earth until the end of the world.

117
01:11:07,559 --> 01:11:10,559
He held to his high destiny.

118
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:14,559
The horde is laid bare, but at a grave cost.

119
01:11:14,559 --> 01:11:17,559
It was too cruel a fate.

120
01:11:17,559 --> 01:11:28,559
Then Werkstern's son, stalwart to the end, had orders given to owners of dwellings to fetch wood from far and wide for the good man's pyre.

121
01:11:29,559 --> 01:11:36,559
They pitched the dragon over the cliff top, let tides flow and backwash take the treasure minder.

122
01:11:40,559 --> 01:11:42,559
It's a miracle it survived.

123
01:11:42,559 --> 01:11:51,559
Like all of Anglo-Saxon poetry, it's astonishing to think that the very root of our literary heritage only just got through.

124
01:11:51,559 --> 01:12:01,559
The faded ink, the singed vellum, the crumbling margins, carrying the word horde down to us.

125
01:12:03,559 --> 01:12:11,559
And the poem itself ends in flames, with Beowulf's body taken to a headland by the sea in his Geert kingdom.

126
01:12:12,559 --> 01:12:19,559
The Geert race then raised up a funeral pyre, shining mail and shields of war and helmets hung upon it.

127
01:12:19,559 --> 01:12:26,559
They laid out in the middle the body of their chief, and on top there then kindled the biggest funeral fire.

128
01:12:28,559 --> 01:12:35,559
The roaring of flames mingled with weeping, as the fire's red heart consumed the house of bone.

129
01:12:36,559 --> 01:12:40,559
Heaven swallowed the smoke.

130
01:12:41,559 --> 01:12:44,559
Beowulf is dead, gone down.

131
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:46,559
Time tells his tale.

132
01:12:46,559 --> 01:12:49,559
Fever forth those favours, lord of fire.

133
01:12:49,559 --> 01:12:51,559
Rise, winter wind.

134
01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:53,559
Beowulf burns.

135
01:12:53,559 --> 01:12:55,559
Beowulf burns.

136
01:12:55,559 --> 01:12:59,559
The hero's boiled blood flows free from mountain peak to sea foam.

137
01:12:59,559 --> 01:13:01,559
He is free forever.

138
01:13:01,559 --> 01:13:03,559
His fame lives forever.

139
01:13:03,559 --> 01:13:05,559
The great worm killed our king.

140
01:13:05,559 --> 01:13:08,559
The black hill burns his bones to dust.

141
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:22,559
Then the Geert people began to construct a mound on a headland, high and imposing,

142
01:13:22,559 --> 01:13:26,559
a marker that sailors could see from far away.

143
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:31,559
It was their hero's memorial, as worthy of him as their workmanship could make it.

144
01:13:31,559 --> 01:13:40,559
And they buried torks in the burrow, and jewels, and a trove of such things as trespassing men had once dared to drag from the hoard.

145
01:13:40,559 --> 01:13:45,559
The beacon to that battle-reckless man they made in ten days.

146
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:49,559
What remained from the fire they cast a wall around,

147
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:53,559
of workmanship as fine as their wisest men could frame for it.

148
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:56,559
They let the ground keep that ancestry,

149
01:13:57,559 --> 01:14:00,559
Then twelve warriors rode around the tomb,

150
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:03,559
chieftains' sons, champions in battle,

151
01:14:03,559 --> 01:14:06,559
all of them distraught, chanting in dirges,

152
01:14:06,559 --> 01:14:10,559
mourning his loss as a man and a king.

153
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:14,559
They extolled his heroic nature and exploits.

154
01:14:14,559 --> 01:14:16,559
He was a hero.

155
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:18,559
He was a hero.

156
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:20,559
He was a hero.

157
01:14:20,559 --> 01:14:22,559
He was a hero.

158
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,559
They extolled his heroic nature and exploits,

159
01:14:26,559 --> 01:14:29,559
and gave thanks for his greatness,

160
01:14:29,559 --> 01:14:31,559
which was the proper thing,

161
01:14:31,559 --> 01:14:34,559
for a man should praise a prince whom he holds dear,

162
01:14:34,559 --> 01:14:36,559
and cherish his memory.

163
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:40,559
All men praised the name of Beowulf.

164
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:43,559
Beowulf!

165
01:14:43,559 --> 01:14:46,559
Beowulf!

166
01:14:46,559 --> 01:14:48,559
Beowulf!

167
01:14:48,559 --> 01:14:50,559
Son of Edd!

168
01:14:50,559 --> 01:14:52,559
And throughout many countries,

169
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:55,559
glee men told tales of him,

170
01:14:55,559 --> 01:14:58,559
even as I have told this tale...

171
01:14:58,559 --> 01:15:00,559
to you.

172
01:15:00,559 --> 01:15:04,559
I must say, all the friends of the world,

173
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:08,559
except for the great one, Gareddica,

174
01:15:09,559 --> 01:15:12,559
you all know him.

175
01:15:12,559 --> 01:15:15,559
He was a glorious man.

176
01:15:15,559 --> 01:15:18,559
They said he had proved, of all kings in the world,

177
01:15:18,559 --> 01:15:22,559
the gentlest of men, the most gracious.

178
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:27,559
Kindest to his people, and keenest to win fame.

179
01:15:39,559 --> 01:15:43,559
That is the end of today's story about Beowulf.

180
01:15:48,559 --> 01:15:52,559
Sandy Grierson played Beowulf in Seamus Heaney's translation,

181
01:15:52,559 --> 01:15:56,559
a bridge by Professor Laura Ash at the University of Oxford.

182
01:15:56,559 --> 01:16:00,559
The dragon poem was written and performed by Patience Agbarbi.

183
01:16:00,559 --> 01:16:04,559
